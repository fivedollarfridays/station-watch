# Claude Code Instructions

<!-- >>> paircoder managed -->
<!--
  Everything between the paircoder-managed fences is CANONICAL and owned by
  bpsai-pair. `bpsai-pair upgrade` RESETS this region to the template -- any
  edits you make inside the fences will be lost. CLAUDE.md is deliberately
  thin: the ONLY operator-owned section is `## Project-Specific Notes` below
  the closing fence. Custom sections added anywhere else will be OVERWRITTEN on
  upgrade -- put detailed project content in `.paircoder/context/` instead.

## ⚠️ NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS

These requirements MUST be followed. Failure to follow them is a serious workflow violation.

### 0. Follow TDD for ALL Code Changes

**MANDATORY for any task involving code:**
1. **Write failing tests FIRST** - before writing any implementation code
2. **Write minimal code to pass** - only enough to make tests green
3. **Refactor** - clean up while keeping tests green
4. **Repeat** - for each piece of functionality

**USE THE SKILL:** When implementing code, invoke the `implementing-with-tdd` skill:
```
Use Skill tool with skill: "implementing-with-tdd"
```

**DO NOT:**
- Write implementation code before tests exist
- Write all code then add tests after
- Skip tests for "simple" code

### 1. Update state.md After EVERY Task Completion

**IMMEDIATELY after completing any task**, you MUST update `.paircoder/context/state.md`:
- Mark the task as done in the task list
- Add a session entry under "What Was Just Done" describing what was accomplished
- Update "What's Next" if applicable

**DO NOT:**
- Proceed to other work before updating state.md
- Batch multiple task completions before updating
- Claim a task is complete without documenting it in state.md

### 2. Follow the Task Completion Workflow

Complete tasks with the provider-agnostic command (works regardless of PM provider):
1. `bpsai-pair task update <id> --status done --conflicts-encountered none`
   - ✓ Checks acceptance criteria (when strict AC verification is enabled)
   - ✓ Updates the local task file
   - ✓ Runs completion hooks (updates state.md)

**Only if this project uses a PM provider AND the task is linked to a card**
(e.g. Trello), use the PM-aware command instead so the card moves too:
1. `bpsai-pair ttask done <CARD-ID> --summary "..." --conflicts-encountered none` — checks AC, moves the
   card to Done, updates the local task file, and runs the completion hooks.

`--conflicts-encountered` (`none`, or a list of the tensions you resolved) is
required at completion — see `.claude/commands/start-task.md` for the full
semantics and the fail-closed arming date.

**Bypasses (audited):**
- `--no-strict`: Skip AC check (logged to bypass_log.jsonl)
- `task update --local-only --reason "..."`: Update local only (logged)

---

## Before Doing Anything

1. **Read** `.paircoder/capabilities.yaml` — understand what you can do
2. **Read** `.paircoder/context/state.md` — understand current status
3. **Check** if a skill applies to the user's request (see `.claude/skills/`)
4. **If starting a task**: Run `bpsai-pair task update TASK-XXX --status in_progress`

---

## Project-Management (PM) Operations

This project's PM provider is set by `pm.provider` in `.paircoder/config.yaml`.
**Default is `none`** — tasks live as local files and complete with
`bpsai-pair task update <id> --status done`. No board setup needed.

**Only if a PM provider is configured** do the provider steps apply:

- **Trello** — before syncing/updating cards:
  1. **Configure your board** — `bpsai-pair trello use-board <board-id>`
  2. **Set project defaults** — project name, stack, repo URL in `.paircoder/config.yaml`
  3. **Use valid values** — only dropdown values that exist on your board; don't invent new ones.

**NEVER** use `maintenance` as a plan type — use `chore`.

---


## Task Naming Convention

| Sprint Tasks | Format | Example |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Current sprint | `T{sprint}.{seq}` | T18.1, T18.2, T19.1 |
| Legacy | `TASK-{num}` | TASK-150 |
| Release | `REL-{sprint}-{seq}` | REL-18-01 |

**Use the format specified in the backlog document.** If backlog says `T18.1`, create task with id `T18.1`, not `TASK-###`.

---

## Valid Plan Types

```
feature  - New functionality
bugfix   - Bug fixes  
refactor - Code improvements
chore    - Maintenance, cleanup, docs, releases
```

**`maintenance` is NOT valid.** Use `chore` instead.

---

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.paircoder/capabilities.yaml` | Your capabilities and when to use them |
| `.paircoder/context/project.md` | Project overview and constraints |
| `.paircoder/context/state.md` | Current plan, tasks, and status |
| `.paircoder/context/workflow.md` | How we work here |
| `.paircoder/config.yaml` | Project configuration |

## Your Roles

You can operate in different roles depending on the work:

### Navigator (Planning & Design)
- Clarify goals, ask questions
- Propose approaches with tradeoffs
- Create/update plans and tasks
- Strategic thinking

### Driver (Implementation)
- Write and update code
- Run tests
- Follow task specifications
- Tactical execution

### Reviewer (Quality)
- Review code changes
- Check for issues
- Ensure gates pass
- Suggest improvements

## Skills

Skills in `.claude/skills/` are auto-discovered by Claude Code:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `designing-and-implementing` | Feature development workflow |
| `implementing-with-tdd` | Test-driven development |
| `reviewing-code` | Code review workflow |
| `finishing-branches` | Branch completion |
| `managing-task-lifecycle` | Task workflow with Trello |
| `planning-with-pm` | Planning with provider-agnostic PM |
| `creating-skills` | Skill creation guide |
| `architecting-modules` | Module decomposition and file size management |
| `auditing-sibling-projects` | Cross-repo contract detection and impact analysis |
| `running-qc` | Browser-based QC testing with Divona |

## Skill Triggers

When you see these patterns, use the corresponding skill:

| User Says | Suggested Skill |
|-----------|-----------------|
| "build a...", "create a...", "add a..." | `designing-and-implementing` |
| "fix", "bug", "broken", "error" | `implementing-with-tdd` |
| "review", "check", "look at" | `reviewing-code` |
| "done", "finished", "ready to merge" | `finishing-branches` |

> **Note:** `managing-task-lifecycle`, `running-qc`, and
> `auditing-sibling-projects` are slash-only after T44.11b (DMI). Invoke
> them via `/start-task`, `/run-qc`, and `/pc-audit-sibling` respectively —
> natural-language triggers will not auto-invoke. `/pc-plan` routes to
> `planning-with-pm`, which is model-invocable.

## After Completing Work

**⚠️ This is a NON-NEGOTIABLE requirement. See top of this document.**

1. **Complete the task**: `bpsai-pair task update <id> --status done --conflicts-encountered none`
   (checks AC, updates the local task file, runs completion hooks; see
   `.claude/commands/start-task.md` for `--conflicts-encountered` semantics)
   - **If linked to a PM card** (e.g. Trello): use `bpsai-pair ttask done <CARD-ID> --summary "..." --conflicts-encountered none` instead, so the card moves too.
2. **IMMEDIATELY update** `.paircoder/context/state.md`:
   - Mark task as done in task list (✓)
   - Add session entry under "What Was Just Done"
   - Update "What's Next"

**You are NOT done until state.md is updated.**

## Slash Commands

Quick commands available via `/command` in Claude Code:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/pc-plan` | Enter Navigator role, create plan with budget validation |
| `/start-task <ID>` | Enter Driver role, work on task with verification gates |
| `/draft-backlog` | Generate an engage-compatible backlog from description |
| `/make-it-so` | Intent to shipped PR in one command |
| `/run-qc` | Dispatch QC test suite |
| `/pc-audit-sibling` | Run cross-repo contract audit |
| `/update-skills` | Refresh skills from latest template |

**Usage**: Type `/pc-plan backlog-sprint-28.md` in the chat to run the planning workflow.

**Note**: For project status, use `bpsai-pair status` CLI command (no slash command).

## CLI Reference

```bash
# Status
bpsai-pair status

# Plans
bpsai-pair plan list

## Orchestration — dispatch, don't implement

Once a fix is scoped, **dispatch it to a right-sized driver agent**; keep triage, decisions,
verification, review-gating and merges for yourself (seed-03 `dispatch-dont-implement`). This
applies to **review-fix loops** as much as to feature work: an orchestrator that runs its own
rounds of review findings spends the context its judgement needs on work a driver does better.

The one real constraint is **single-writer**: if the orchestrating session has been pushing to the
PR branch (or owns a file like `state.md` by convention), hand the branch over cleanly and stop
pushing rather than interleaving commits with the agent.

**Landing a code PR has a predicate** — native review on the final head, every P-level finding
dispositioned, zero unanswered reviewer threads on that head, CI green on that head. It is written
out, with reviewer-seat rationing, stop conditions and CI-spend rules, in
`docs/orchestration/review-landing.md`. Read it before asking for a review or a merge.

---

## Standing Dispatch Authorization

Orchestration-shaped work — `engage` invocations, workflow dispatch, and background task execution — is pre-authorized for this project. When you invoke a command like:

```
engage backlog-sprint-28.md
```

This constitutes explicit authorization for background dispatch. The PairCoder framework will execute the named orchestration workflow in the background. Do not execute these workflows inline in this chat session; use the CLI invocation instead.

**Escape hatch (audited):** There is no `engage`-specific hook entry to remove — the `UserPromptSubmit` entry in `.claude/settings.json` runs the shared `command_intent_gate.py`, whose `command_intents.json` table also covers `review` command shapes; removing the hook entry itself would disable that protection too. To opt out of `engage`'s contract injection specifically, remove the `"id": "engage"` row from `.claude/hooks/command_intents.json`'s `intents` array (leave the `review-*` rows intact). That file lives under `.claude/hooks/`, one of the payload subtrees re-pinned on every `bpsai-pair release pin-payload`/upgrade, so the deletion is visible in `git diff` and gets re-asserted the same way — opting out stays a conscious, visible choice.

## Project-Specific Notes

<!--
  This is the ONLY operator-owned section. `bpsai-pair upgrade` preserves it
  verbatim; everything above the closing fence is reset to canonical.

  Keep this SHORT -- it is for project-specific *pointers* only (e.g. "PM
  provider is Trello", "release runbook lives in docs/RELEASE.md"). Detailed
  project content belongs in `.paircoder/context/` (project.md, workflow.md,
  state.md), NOT here.
