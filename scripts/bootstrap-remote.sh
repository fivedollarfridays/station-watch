#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/bootstrap-remote.sh -- Install bpsai-pair into a fresh CC cloud session
#
# Called by the SessionStart hook in .claude/settings.json. CC fires
# SessionStart on EVERY session (local interactive, local headless via
# `claude -p`, cloud / Ultra Plan online sessions), so this script gates
# on CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE (set automatically by CC in cloud sessions, per
# https://code.claude.com/docs/en/env-vars) to ensure it only runs where
# bpsai-pair is genuinely missing.
#
# Local sessions already have bpsai-pair installed on the operator's
# machine -- running an install over a fresh dev venv was the v2.25.6
# incident pattern. Cloud sessions start from a fresh remote env that
# does not have bpsai-pair, so installing it there preserves enforcement
# semantics when the operator hands off from local CC to Ultra Plan.
#
# Why --no-deps + explicit deps:
#   Full `pip install bpsai-pair` fails in containerized environments
#   because transitive deps (toggl, slumber) can't build wheels due to
#   setuptools install_layout incompatibility. The CLI only needs a
#   subset of deps for enforcement, task lifecycle, and telemetry.
#
# Behavior on failure:
#   - Loud banner on stderr (CC SessionStart shows stderr to the user)
#   - Append a structured audit entry to .paircoder/telemetry/bootstrap_audit.jsonl
#   - exit 1 (non-blocking per CC's SessionStart contract; the session
#     continues, but subsequent bpsai-pair-aware operations will fail
#     naturally and the banner tells the operator why)

# Gate: only run in CC cloud sessions.

# Core runtime deps — the minimum set CLI startup needs to import without
# crashing. `bpsai_pair.commands.__init__` imports every subcommand module
# at load time, which transitively requires:
#   typer click rich   — Typer CLI framework (click is a typer dep but kept explicit)
#   pyyaml tiktoken    — config + token counting at startup
#   pydantic           — licensing.schema models loaded via commands/orchestrate
#   httpx              — commands/subscription module-level import
#   packaging          — telemetry/auto_archive.py + commands/upgrade_prompt.py,
#                        both run on EVERY mutating command via cli_startup.py's
#                        hooks (missing here previously meant a CC cloud-session
#                        bootstrap still lacked it even after pyproject declared it,
#                        and the pre-T1 hook's ImportError quieting then hid the gap)
#   platformdirs       — commands/doctor_editable_ack.py module-level import
#   tenacity           — gitops/retry.py, re-exported by gitops/__init__.py
# Verified empirically: a venv with just these can run `bpsai-pair --version`,
# `status`, and every hook command wired in `.claude/settings.json`.
# Drift guard: tests/core/test_bootstrap_startup_import_coverage.py walks the
# whole module-level import graph reachable from `commands/__init__.py` and
# `gitops/__init__.py` and fails when this array does not cover it.
#
# Exact-pinned (== not a range) -- same supply-chain rationale as
# PINNED_VERSION above: an unpinned array let every cloud session
# auto-install the LATEST release of each dep, undermining that
# rationale for everything BUT the wheel itself. Each pin must also
# satisfy pyproject.toml's own declared range for that dependency --
# enforced by tests/core/test_bootstrap_remote_dep_pins.py. Bump
# alongside PINNED_VERSION on the release checklist.
